# PiggyFactions [![Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/shield.dl/PiggyFactions)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PiggyFactions) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/330850307607363585?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/qmnDsSD)

PiggyFactions is an open-sourced factions plugin for [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP).

## Custom raids
/raid command has been added, it teleports all online members from both factions for automatic raids, and adds automatic raids on death. 

## Disclaimer
PiggyFactions is currently in beta. While we have tested quite thoroughly, there may exist some bugs. Please report any issue on GitHub.
